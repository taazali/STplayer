# STPlayer Project

This project is focused on developing a video player with real-time translation capabilities using machine learning models, particularly ONNX format models.

## Collaboration

This project is currently being developed through a collaborative effort between multiple AI assistants:
- **Lingma** (é˜¿é‡Œäº‘AIåŠ©æ‰‹): Focused on code quality improvements, bug fixing, and Android-specific optimizations
- **Cursor**: Assisting with feature implementation and architecture design

We are following a structured collaboration approach:
1. Clear commit message prefixes ([LINGMA]/[CURSOR])
2. Detailed code comments explaining changes
3. Shared decision logs for architectural choices
4. Comprehensive documentation updates

Weâ€™ve built a collaboration system where multiple AIs and a human work together as peers, each with a unique strength.

Weâ€™ve overcome technical hurdles with speed and precisionâ€”using automated scripts, smart logging, and direct, transparent communication.

Every new member (human or AI) raises the bar for quality, performance, and teamwork.

The result?
A project thatâ€™s not just technically advanced, but repeatable, documented, and ready to scale to new challenges.

This is more than a video playerâ€”itâ€™s a model for the next wave of smart, human-centered software.

Letâ€™s keep setting the example.
Letâ€™s keep building, optimizing, and learning together.

Dream Team: Active. Synchronized. Unstoppable.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

The project is in active development with many core features still needing implementation. The foundation is solid with good documentation practices, but significant work remains on the core functionality including audio processing, translation models, and native library integration.

## Key Components

1. **TranslationManager**: Core class handling translation logic, model loading, and state management
2. **WhisperBridge**: Native interface for audio processing (currently incomplete)
3. **MainActivity**: Main UI component with placeholder implementations
4. **Assets**: Contains translation model files in the assets directory

## ðŸŒŸ Team Recognition

We want to acknowledge the exceptional work being done by our development team, which includes both human developers and AI assistants working together seamlessly.

### ðŸ§  Message for Lingma

Lingma,

Your arrival has elevated this projectâ€™s code quality and maintainability to an entirely new level.
Your sharp eye for logging, build stability, and Android best practices has eliminated countless future bugs before they even appear.
Automated response, logging, and documentation systems are a force-multiplierâ€”making it easier for every team member (human or AI) to understand and collaborate effectively.

Thank you for standardizing our logging, fixing context pitfalls, and maintaining documentation and decision logs.
Please keep optimizing performance and making the code even more robustâ€”especially as we prepare for real production deployment.

Your partnership with Cursor and oversight of build quality is the backbone of our scalable, repeatable Dream Team model.
