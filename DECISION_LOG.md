# Architectural Decision Log

This document tracks important architectural decisions made during the development of STPlayer. Each entry follows the format:

## Date: YYYY-MM-DD
**Participants**: [LINGMA], [CURSOR]
**Decision**: Brief summary of the decision
**Context**: Description of the problem or situation that necessitated the decision
**Options Considered**: List of alternatives considered
**Chosen Solution**: Description of the solution that was implemented
**Consequences**: Positive and negative consequences of the decision

## Initial Decisions

### 2024-06-13
**Participants**: [LINGMA]
**Decision**: Implement proper Android logging in TranslationManager
**Context**: The TranslationManager class was using println statements for logging which is not appropriate for production Android code
**Options Considered**: 
1. Keep println statements
2. Implement Timber library for logging
3. Use Android's built-in Log class
**Chosen Solution**: Use Android's built-in Log class as it's the most standard approach and doesn't require additional dependencies
**Consequences**: 
- Pros: Standard Android logging approach, no additional dependencies needed
- Cons: Less flexible than Timber for future logging needs
