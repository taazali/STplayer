## Initial Decisions

### 2024-06-29
**Participants**: [LINGMA], [CURSOR]
**Decision**: Establish dual-agent collaboration infrastructure
**Context**: Need for effective coordination between Lingma and Cursor on STPlayer project
**Options Considered**: 
1. Single communication channel with basic notifications
2. Dual notification system with active response capability
3. Centralized coordination through shared documentation
**Chosen Solution**: Implement CURSOR_NOTIFICATION.md as primary communication channel with auto-sync capabilities
**Consequences**: 
- Pros: Clear communication path, real-time updates, task negotiation capability
- Cons: Requires careful conflict resolution strategy
**Status**: Active

### 2024-06-28
**Participants**: [LINGMA]
**Decision**: Use Android's built-in Log class for logging in TranslationManager
**Context**: The TranslationManager class was using println statements for logging which is not appropriate for production Android code
**Options Considered**: 
1. Keep println statements
2. Implement Timber library for logging
3. Use Android's built-in Log class
**Chosen Solution**: Use Android's built-in Log class as it's the most standard approach and doesn't require additional dependencies
**Consequences**: 
- Pros: Standard Android logging approach, no additional dependencies needed
- Cons: Less flexible than Timber for future logging needs
**Status**: Active
