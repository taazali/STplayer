# Auto-Sync Test File

This file was created to test if the auto-sync script is working properly.

**Test timestamp:** $(date)

If you see this file appear in your Android Studio Cloud environment within 30 seconds of me creating it, then the auto-sync is working! ðŸŽ‰

## How to verify:
1. Check if this file appears in your project
2. Check the sync.log file for pull activity
3. The timestamp should be recent

## Expected sync.log output:
```
Updates found! Pulling changes...
Sync complete!
```
